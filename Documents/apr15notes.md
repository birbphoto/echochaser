## Tried out a few new color schemes, results are in #polls.

I'm trying to figure out which to use. #1 was the first iteration, and #2 was another which wasn't colored.
I ended up trying adding the red from #1 into #2 which made it not look horrible, but the results are still split.

#3 is another and #4 is the #1/2 hybrid. Seems that #1 and 4 are the most liked, but #2 might be good for flashbacks or moody scenes, I'll also see if I can modify the character sprites to match as well. (I probably will need another color scheme, it's too dark.)

I need to update the ./gowallconfig.yml here in the Documents folder. I have it on my Manjaro machine, I'll do it when I get home. Problem is, it's not Debian supported yet so I need to make it using Go, which I still need to figure out on Debian. (I use it on laptop/chromebook)

## I need a reminder :P

Once the script finishes and we start putting everyone to work, I'll make the repository private. Maybe make a private branch. *(is that a thing?)*
