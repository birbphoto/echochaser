Vocal chain is in Docs. If you need to batch process, use Audacity but Ableton should be for final renders.
Note Ren'Py doesn't support starting/ending timestamps easily.

(finnzier ship goes hard af)

Font ideas for UI
    Embed Nerd fonts into *game directory* so all cloners can pull and update.
    
    I doubt DepartureMono is the right fit. Maybe? Make a branch, I guess.

See if .rpyc can be added to .gitignore, cloners may not need it to run, and it's using unnecessary space.

Figure out directory-- Manjaro isn't working. Problem is likely Rpy, try launching cd's in different spots. Maybe from echochaser/ (Contains Docs/ and Echo\ Chaser/)

(i hate ren'py)

Next tests:
    - Video
    - Say with (get VAs to add tests)
    - install.sh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (Maybe in 1.2)
    - Do more Transform IL for animation (maybe in 1.2)
    - Gifs? (animation for characters or BG)
    - Consistent pulls on any machine (if it works it works, see install.sh)
    - Get Luca's stuff set up
    - Try all audio layers.

We can deal without the CSay function atm.

No need for a pull reminder atm, music from home is already there.

REMINDERS:
    Madison will send in VA lines after school for 1.1-- definitely put her on the queue because some of our actual VAs haven't done it yet (YES IM TALKING TO YOU)
